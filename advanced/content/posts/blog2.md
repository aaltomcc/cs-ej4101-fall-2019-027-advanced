# A few things I have learned while making this Website:

>Before, this course I did not even know you could make a website using **GITHUB**. Though I have made websites before, something about making one by using **GITHUB** made it more satisfying. Perhaps, it was the blend of version control using **GIT** and viewing it using **GITHUB Pages**. I got introduced to the Markdown Language via the online lessons. Some things like the _Italic_, **Bold** and the Header were familiar. 

>However, most of the things were quite new to me. Adding links and images felt like the important things I have learned when it comes to the lessons. Another thing I’ve learned was that the pages don’t get updated immediately as you commit your changes. It usually takes a few minutes until the changes can be seen in the website. One thing I was stuck on was first title of the website. The title was the following:
>
>### cs-ej4101-fall-2019-027-starter
>
>Even though it was not mentioned in the _Diary-027.md_ file. A coordinator had posted a recommendation in Slack on how to fix this problem. A _config.yml_ file had to be made, where I could add my preferred title. The additional files like...
>
>* README
>* GITIGNORE
>* etc
>
>...have to be added too as this is a version control folder. However, I was familiar with these from previous projects.
